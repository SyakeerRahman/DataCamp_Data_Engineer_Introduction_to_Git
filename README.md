# DataCamp_Data_Engineer_Introduction_to_Git

Course Description <br />

This course introduces learners to version control using Git. You will discover the importance of version control when working on data science projects and explore how you can use Git to track files, compare differences, modify and save files, undo changes, and allow collaborative development through the use of branches. You will gain an introduction to the structure of a repository, how to create new repositories and clone existing ones, and show how Git stores data. By working through typical data science tasks, you will gain the skills to handle conflicting files.

### 1. Introduction to Git

In the first chapter, you’ll learn what version control is and why it is essential for data projects. Then, you’ll discover what Git is and how to use it for a version control workflow.

- [ ] Comparing files
- [ ] What has changed?
- [ ] What's going to be committed?
- [ ] What's in the staging area?

### 2, Making changes

Next, you’ll examine how Git stores data, learn essential commands to compare files and repositories at different times, and understand the process for restoring earlier versions of files in your data projects.

- [ ] Storing data with Git
- [ ] Interpreting the commit structure
- [ ] Viewing a repository's history

- [ ] Deleting untracked files
- [ ] Restoring an old version of a file

### 3. Git workflows

In this chapter, you'll learn tips and tricks for configuring Git to make you more efficient! You'll also discover branches, identify how to create and switch to different branches, compare versions of files between branches, merge branches together, and deal with conflicting files across branches.

- [ ] Configuring Git
- [ ] Modifying your email address in Git
- [ ] Creating an alias
- [ ] Ignoring files

- [ ] Switching branches
- [ ] Merging two branches
- [ ] Handling conflict
- [ ] Recognizing conflict syntax
- [ ] Resolving a conflict

### 4. Collaborating with Git

This final chapter is all about collaboration! You'll gain an introduction to remote repositories and learn how to work with them to synchronize content between the cloud and your local computer. You'll also see how to create new repositories and clone existing ones, along with discovering a workflow to minimize the risk of conflicts between local and remote repositories.

- [ ] Creating repos
- [ ] Setting up a new repo
- [ ] Converting an existing project
- [ ] Working with remotes
- [ ] Cloning a repo
- [ ] Defining and identifying remotes
